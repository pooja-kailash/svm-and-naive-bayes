        "   - What is Information Gain?\n",
        "\n",
        "It is a metric used in machine learning to determine which feature is most effective for splitting data at a given node in a decision tree.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is calculated as the difference between the entropy of the dataset before the split and the weighted average of the entropy after the split.\n",
        "\n",

        "   - How it's used in Decision Trees\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Root Node Selection: The algorithm calculates the Information Gain for every feature in the dataset and chooses the one with the highest gain to be the root node.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Splitting and Branching: The dataset is split into subsets based on the values of the chosen feature. This process creates child nodes.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Recursive Selection: The process is repeated for each new child node. The algorithm evaluates the remaining features to find the one with the highest Information Gain for that specific subset of data and splits it again.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Stopping Condition: The algorithm continues to split nodes until a stopping condition is met, such as reaching a maximum depth, having nodes with very low entropy (pure nodes), or when no features remain to split on.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Classification/Prediction: Once the tree is built, it can be used for classification. To classify a new data point, you traverse the tree from the root down to a leaf node, following the branches based on the features of the data point. The leaf node then provides the predicted class."
